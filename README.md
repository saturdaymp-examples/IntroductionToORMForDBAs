# Introduction To ORMs For DBAs

All the items for a lighting talk I'm thinking of giving.  It introduces ORMs to DBAs and explains why developers use ORMs, when ORMs are usuful and when then aren't.  No slides yet but the first part of talk draft can be found [here](https://nftb.saturdaymp.com/introduction-to-object-relational-mapping-for-dbas-part-1/).  The source code for talk can be found in the Source folder.

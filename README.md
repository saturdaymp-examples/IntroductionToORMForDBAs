# Introduction To ORMs For DBAs

The [slides](Slides) and the [source code](Source) for a lighting talk I gave for the [SQL Saturday Edmonton - Speaker Idol Contest](https://www.meetup.com/EDMPASS/events/244468043/).  I didn't win the competition but I enjoyed giving the talk and listening to the other talks.

You can find ruff draft of my talk below.  It's not exactly what I said but has the general idea.

* [Part 3](https://nftb.saturdaymp.com/introduction-to-object-relational-mapping-for-dbas-part-3/)

Even though I didn't win I am still planning on submitting a longer version of this talk for [SQL Saturday #710 Edmonton](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/710/eventhome.aspx) in May.  Constructive feedback and critisim is apprecated.

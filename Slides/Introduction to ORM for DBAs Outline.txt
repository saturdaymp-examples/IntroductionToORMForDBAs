Point of view for the Talk
 - From DBA that has little to no programming experience.
 - Has had to deal with wierd queries from ORM (example)
 - DBA writing an application for the first time?




What is ORM?
  - Wiki definition
  - Mapping relational data to objects
  - Core problem is dealing with data in an application

What is a object?
  - Definition of class and object.
  - Exmple of class, object, etc.

What problem is it trying to solve?
  - Translating data from relational to object
  - Remove boiler plate code

Demo
  - Entity framwork CRUD demo.  Compare to non-ORM code?
  - Talk about objects

** Maybe?
Types of ORM
  - Active record vs Respository

Demo
  - Ruby on Rails
** End Maybe

Looks Easy but it's really hard
  - Effienct queries
  - 

Ideal application archecture
  - Service "protecting" the database.










Quick Demo

Looks Easy but it's really hard

 - Demo Entity Framework

Definitions:
